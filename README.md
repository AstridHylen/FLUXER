<h3>Welcome to Flux Evaluation in R (FLUXER)!</h3> 

This app allows you to easily calculate sediment-water fluxes of dissolved compounds using
linear regression, with the help of robust quality checks of your data.

To access the app from GitHub, simply open RStudio, load the 'shiny' package and type the following in the console:

```
runGitHub( "Fluxer", "AstridHylen")
```

The app should install all required packages automatically, but if this does not work, try manually installing: "shiny", "bslib", "openxlsx", "readxl", "lmtest", "AICcmodavg", "tidyverse", "patchwork", "ggrepel", "markdown"

The app was written by Astrid Hyl√©n (University of Antwerp, Belgium) and
Sebastiaan van de Velde (National Institute of Water and Atmospheric
Research & University of Otago, New Zealand).
